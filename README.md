# employee-crud-app
Simple employee management CRUD application

Created using HTML5 Boilerplate (version 8.0.0) and Boostrap (version 3.4.1) as part of a project-based course using PHP and MySQL by Jazeb Akram, Udemy instructor, with some minor modifications. For example, the JavaScript redirect is applied across all CRUD pages, and snake case is used throughout particularly for the database fields.
